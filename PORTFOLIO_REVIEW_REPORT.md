## Priority Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (P0)
1. **Extract inline CSS/JS** to external files
2. **Implement CSP headers** for security
3. **Add build process** (Vite/Webpack)
4. **Fix accessibility issues** (ARIA labels, focus styles)

### Short-term (P1)
1. **Add automated testing** framework
2. **Implement CI/CD** pipeline
3. **Optimize performance** (minification, lazy loading)
4. **Add structured data** for SEO

### Long-term (P2)
1. **Migrate to component-based** architecture
2. **Add TypeScript** for type safety
3. **Implement design system**
4. **Add comprehensive documentation**

## Compliance Status

- **WCAG 2.1 AA:** ❌ Non-compliant
- **ADA Title II:** ❌ Non-compliant
- **EU EAA (June 2025):** ❌ Will not meet requirements
- **Performance Budget:** ❌ No budget defined

## Business Impact

**Risks:**
- Legal exposure due to accessibility non-compliance
- Poor SEO performance limiting discoverability
- Security vulnerabilities could damage reputation
- Performance issues on mobile devices (60%+ of traffic)

**Opportunities:**
- 15% of global population has disabilities (untapped audience)
- Better performance = higher conversion rates
- Improved SEO = more organic traffic

## Conclusion

While the portfolio successfully presents content and demonstrates basic web development skills, it requires significant improvements to meet enterprise standards. The monolithic architecture, inline code, and accessibility issues are the most critical concerns. Implementing the recommended changes would improve the score from 65/100 to potentially 90+/100.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Create a development roadmap based on priority recommendations
2. Set up proper development tooling and workflows
3. Implement automated testing and monitoring
4. Schedule regular accessibility audits
