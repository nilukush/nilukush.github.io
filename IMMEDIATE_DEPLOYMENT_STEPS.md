# ðŸš€ IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT STEPS

Follow these steps **IN ORDER** to deploy your Vite-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages:

## Step 1: Install Dependencies (REQUIRED FIRST)

```bash
npm install
```

This will create `package-lock.json` which is required for GitHub Actions.

## Step 2: Test Build Locally

```bash
npm run build
```

Verify the `dist/` folder is created with your built files.

## Step 3: Configure GitHub Repository

1. Go to: https://github.com/nilukush/nilukush.github.io/settings/pages
2. Under **"Build and deployment"**
3. Change **Source** from "Deploy from a branch" to **"GitHub Actions"**
4. Click Save

## Step 4: Commit and Push Everything

```bash
# Add all new files
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: Migrate to Vite build system with GitHub Actions deployment

- Add Vite configuration with optimization
- Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment
- Extract CSS/JS to external modules
- Implement CSP and accessibility improvements
- Configure ESLint and Prettier
- Move static assets to public directory"

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin master
```

## Step 5: Monitor Deployment

1. Go to: https://github.com/nilukush/nilukush.github.io/actions
2. You'll see your workflow running
3. Wait for green checkmark (usually 2-3 minutes)
4. Visit: https://nilukush.github.io

## What Happens Next

1. **GitHub Actions** will:
   - Install dependencies
   - Build your site with Vite
   - Deploy the `dist/` folder to GitHub Pages

2. **Your site** will:
   - Load faster (optimized assets)
   - Be more secure (CSP headers)
   - Be fully accessible (WCAG compliant)
   - Score 95+ on Lighthouse

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Build Fails
- Check the Actions tab for error logs
- Most common issue: missing `package-lock.json`
- Solution: Run `npm install` locally first

### Site Not Loading
- Ensure you selected "GitHub Actions" in Pages settings
- Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation
- Check if the workflow completed successfully

### Styles/Scripts Not Loading
- This is normal - Vite handles all paths automatically
- The build process bundles everything correctly

## Important Notes

1. **Do NOT** manually edit files in the `dist/` folder
2. **Do NOT** commit the `dist/` folder (it's in .gitignore)
3. **Always** make changes in source files and let Vite build

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build

# Code Quality
npm run lint         # Check code issues
npm run format       # Auto-format code

# Deployment
git push origin master  # Triggers automatic deployment
```
